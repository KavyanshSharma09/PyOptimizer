🧠 Smart Compute Analyzer

Smart Compute Analyzer is an intelligent Python tool that analyzes the computational complexity of Python programs, detects heavy loops and vectorizable operations, and automatically suggests or applies optimizations—like GPU acceleration using CuPy. It's designed to assist developers in writing efficient, high-performance Python code without manual performance tuning.

🚀 Features

🔍 Loop Complexity AnalyzerDetects nested loops and estimates computational load.

🧪 NumPy Operation DetectorIdentifies opportunities for vectorization and efficient array processing.

🛠️ Code OptimizerSuggests improvements like loop unrolling, vectorization, or parallel execution.

⚡ Automatic GPU AcceleratorConverts NumPy code to CuPy when heavy computation is detected.

📆 Modular DesignEasy to extend and integrate into editors, APIs, or ML pipelines.



🔧 How to Use

1. 🔨 Analyze a Python File

You can now provide a path to a .py file as input:

python main.py path/to/your_file.py

This will analyze the code for:

Loop complexity

NumPy usage

Optimization suggestions

GPU acceleration if applicable



🧠 Example Output

Complexity Analysis: {'loop_depth': 3, 'is_computation_heavy': True}

NumPy Operations: []

Optimization Suggestions:
- Consider vectorizing triple nested loops
- Use GPU acceleration for large-scale computations

=== Program is Computationally Heavy ===
Recommended optimizations:
1. GPU Acceleration using CuPy
2. Vectorization of numpy operations
3. Parallel processing for heavy loops

Optimized Code with GPU Acceleration:
... # Transformed code output

📌 Dependencies

Python 3.7+

(Optional) CuPy for GPU acceleration

NumPy (if your code uses it)

Install dependencies using:

pip install numpy cupy

🗺 Vision
